### Problem 4 - Dutch National Flag Problem

Traverse the list and relocate the number into corresponding buckets. Bucket 1(0) start at the beginning of the array, bucket 2(1) follows bucket 1, bucket 3(2) is at the end of the array.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)

Traverse the list once, therefore, O(n)

**Space Complexity:** O(0)

It's done in place, therefore, O(0)
